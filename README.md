#### Credit where credit's due
- The image used for the holographic effect on the photo of me is an edited version of this [awesome image on unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/wB2oMozC1IU). Shout out to Quang Vy!
- The holgraphic effect is inspired by this awesome technique by [Rob Bowen](https://robbowen.digital/wrote-about/css-blend-mode-shaders/), so great, and nice to not have to add a heavy dependency like three.js for this.
